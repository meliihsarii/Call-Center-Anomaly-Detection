# Call-Center-Anomaly-Detection

The aim of the project is to detect an anomaly in the call center of the municipality if the general call about the same issue, the same location and the general call related to that subject and location generated traffic outside the development. Determine the anomaly by analyzing these calls retrospectively at 15-minute intervals in a service in the back.After exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing phase, the model was built by Autoencoder.

This project was carried out with Ayşenur Erbahar, Ezgi Karakuş, Gizem Dağdeviren and Melih Sarı, which is in collaboration with Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.
Also, many thanks to Embassy of the United States and University of Virginia because of their great contributions and supports!
