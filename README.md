# Call-Center-Anomaly-Detection

The aim of the project is to detect an anomaly in the call center of the municipality if the general call about the same issue, the same location and the general call related to that subject and location generated traffic outside the development. Determine the anomaly by analyzing these calls retrospectively at 15-minute intervals in a service in the back.

This project carried out with Ayşenur Erbahar, Ezgi Karakuş and Gizem Dağdeviren, which is collaboration with Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.
